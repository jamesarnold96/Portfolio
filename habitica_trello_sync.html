      <h1>Habitica/Trello task syncing</h1>
	  <h3>Using Tasker for Android</h3>
    </div>
      
    <div class="content">
      <p><a href="https://tasker.joaoapps.com/">Tasker</a> is a popular Android
      task automation app, which provides its own JavaScript scripting
      system. I used this to write an app which syncs data between the popular 
      planning and todo apps <a href="https://habitica.com/">Habitica</a> and
      <a href="https://trello.com/">Trello</a>. This is broken up into re-arrangeable
      chunks, which can be used for various tasks by the user. I actually think 
      that this 
      approach can be applied to a wide range of web app types, to reduce our
      unhealthy dependence on external (often large) web service companies like
      Google and Facebook.

      <h3>Why Habitica?</h3>
      <p>I consider myself unfortunately overburdened with more curiosity than 
      is probably healthy, and often find 
      effective time management difficult. I also struggle with planning and task
      prioritizing. Luckily, I have found salvation in
      the utterly brilliant website and app 
      <a href="https://habitica.com/">Habitica</a>, which 
      turns task management into an RPG game, making the whole process much more
      fun and useful, and makes me far more productive (as a side note, it is
      similar to a somewhat cruder text game I created in high school). It 
      provides health and xp systems for when I've completed/failed tasks,
      as well as a neat and flexible reward system.</p>
      <h3>Why Trello?</h3>
      <p>Another task-management website I struggle to live without is the
      also brilliant <a href="https://trello.com/">Trello</a>, which is very 
      common for organizing group projects. If you haven't seen it already, it 
      displays tasks using a pinboard-style layout, which allows tasks ("cards")
      to be grouped by category. A user can also have multiple boards. This 
      visual style is extremely useful for project planning and organizing tasks.</p>
      <h3>The Syncing Dillema</h3>
      <p>Both of these services are very good for different purposes, Trello for
      its pinboard interface, and Habitica for its scoring, reward and social 
      systems. However, there is currently no way of syncing tasks between these
      services that I am aware of. The 
      <a href="https://github.com/DC23/scriptabit">only one I could find</a> 
      didn't work properly for me. Luckily, both services provide HTTP APIs, so
      it is possible to create a 
      web app to do the task syncing relatively easily. Common apps for this
      kind of thing like IFTTT don't work for this case.</p>
      <h3>Enter Tasker</h3>
      <p>To implement this, I took the somewhat unusual step of using the Android
      automation app <a href="https://tasker.joaoapps.com/">Tasker</a>. This was beacuse most people have 
      a smartphone nowadays, which is connected to the internet most of the time. 
      This allows it to periodically sync tasks in a way a PC cannot, and be 
      scheduled to do so at specific times. Importantly, Tasker is also straightforward
      for non-programmers to use, so using this would allow these people to 
      customize it to their liking. To make development easier, I also created a simple
      Python web server using the <a href="http://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/">Bottle 
      library</a>, which allows Tasker routines to be tested on a PC, 
      substatially speeding up the development and debugging process.</p>
      <h3>Current Status</h3>
      <p>The functions for getting the task data from the internet are complete,
      as is the test site and server. The actual syncing code, along with code 
      to upload the new data to the websites, is still in progress.</p>
