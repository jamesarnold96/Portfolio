      <p>Over the past year, I have been part of the Imperial College Game 
      Development society, as part of a project building a 2D Super-Mario-syle
      2D platform game. This is being built using the Unity platform This has 
      helped me significantly develop my programming 
      skills, and gave me the opportunity to learn the C# programming language. 
      The game works by giving the player a deck of cards, which can be used to
      clear levels. There is a great deal of flexibility in how these cards can
      be used, and a lot of the skill involves choosing the correct cards for
      levels, and using them in a creative way.
      <h3>Current Status</h3>
      <p>The first level (the tutorial) of this game is currently playble, with the
      basic character and camera controls working. The card deck system is also
      written, along with "fire" cards, which are able to spawn projectiles. 
      Money and health systems have also been implemented. Once the basic 
      mechanics are implemented, I will start fleshing out the general structure
      of the game. Some ideas I have for it are:
      <ul>
        <li>A highly random approach to elements of the level design and upgrades,
        so part of the skill of playing involves dealing with chance.</li>
        <li>Competetive multiplayer</li>
        <li>"MetroidVania" level style, where there is only one, continuous, large 
        map, rather than several smaller ones.</li>
        <li>Lewis Carroll-style fun, but surreal storyline, exploring the nature 
        of how people view each other.</li>
      </ul>
