      <h1>EEBug</h1>
	  <h3>Line Following Robot</h3>
    </div>
      
    <div class="content">
      <p>My first year university group projct was to design and construct a small 
      line-following robot within a specified time frame and budget. I was the 
      team leader for this project, which provided me with valuable leadership 
      experience and project planning skills. The robot had to follow a line drawn
	  onto a sheet of paper, continue for bit, spiral, and then stop.</p>
	  <h3>How it works</h3>
	  <p>The EEBug was controlled by a microcontroller, specifically an Atmel ATTiny85.
	  This was used as the number of microcontoller pins allowed was limited. The ATTiny
	  was programmed using the popular Arduino platform. To detect the line, a pair of 
	  infrared light detectors were mounted on the front of the bug, to detect the intensity 
	  light reflected from the surface below by some infrared LEDs. The black line 
	  would reflefct less than the white, meaning that the robot could always move 
	  towards the black. When the line stopped, the move straight and spiral routines
	  were triggered. A buzzer, which played small tunes at the stop and start rounded
	  it off with a bit of flair.</p>
