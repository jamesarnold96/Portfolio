<h1>Music</h1>
<p>I am a very keen musician for most of my life, and this is my main interest 
outside of electrical engineering and computer programming. I am fluent at 
piano and violin and have played in various concerts and competitions over the
years (although not won much. Alas, that is why I changed career paths!). 
Recently, I have been increasingly interested in music composition, and I am in
the process of writing a variety of tracks for a 2D SNES-style RPG I have in 
progress.</p> 
<p>
This page is intended to be a showcase of the pieces I have completed, 
as well as some in an advanced state of completion. If you enjoy listening to
them even a fraction as much as I've enjoyed writing them, then I feel the whole
thing will have been worth it.</p>
<h2>Battle Theme</h2>
<p>This is intended to be the main battle theme the RPG game. It is inspired by
'80s Sci Fi themes and '90s video game music, with pulsating guitars and 
space-age FM synths. It is intended to be both intense, yet kinda catchy at the
same time. I intend the mechanics of the game's battle system to be much like
a 2D fighting game, so this intense, fast-paced theme reflects this.</p>
