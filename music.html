    <h1>Music</h1>
  </div>
  <div class="content">
    <p>I am a very keen musician for most of my life, and this is my main interest 
    outside of electrical engineering and computer programming. I am fluent at 
    piano and violin and have played in various concerts and competitions over the
    years (although not won much. Alas, that is why I changed career paths!). 
    Recently, I have been increasingly interested in music composition, and I am in
    the process of writing a variety of tracks for a 2D SNES-style RPG I have in 
    progress.</p> 
    <p>
    This page is intended to be a showcase of the pieces I have completed, 
    as well as some in an advanced state of completion. If you enjoy listening to
    them even a fraction as much as I've enjoyed writing them, then I feel the whole
    thing will have been worth it.</p>
    <h2>Battle Theme</h2>

    <p>This is intended to be the main battle theme the RPG game. It is inspired by
    '80s Sci Fi themes and '90s video game music, with pulsating guitars and 
    space-age FM synths. It is intended to be both intense, yet kinda catchy at the
    same time. I intend the mechanics of the game's battle system to be much like
    a 2D fighting game, so this intense, fast-paced theme reflects this.</p>
