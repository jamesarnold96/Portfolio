<h1>Music</h1>
I am a very keen musician for most of my life, and this is my main interest 
outside of electrical engineering and computer programming. I am fluent at 
piano and violin and have played in various concerts and competitions over the
years (although not won much. Alas, that is why I changed career paths!). 
Recently, I have been increasingly interested in music composition, and I am in
the process of writing a variety of tracks for a 2D SNES-style RPG I have in 
progress.

This page is intended to be a showcase of the pieces I have completed, 
as well as some in an advanced state of completion. If you enjoy listening to
them even a fraction as much as I've enjoyed writing them, the whole effort 
wouldn't have been in vain!
