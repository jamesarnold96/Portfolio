      <p>My second 3rd-year project was an embedded systems project to write the
      software for a brushless motor controller. The code needed to be able to 
      make the motor rotate a set number of rotations, which had to be significantly
      accurate. This was set by the user, who could also control the maximum 
      rotational velocity of the motor. Whilst this was going on, the 
      microcontroller also computed bitcoin hashes in the background.</p>

      <h3>How it Works</h3>
      <p>The brushless motor works by a series of electromagnets around the motor
      being magnetized in sequence, attracting the magnetic rotor to be attracted
      to them. The position of the rotor was measured using a series of infrared
      LEDs and sensors. The rotor had a large slot in it, so when the slot 
      passed over an LED, the sensor would no longer detect a signal. 
      Using this information to control the motor (a closed-loop feedback system)
      required a strong grasp of control theory, particularly PID control systems, to stop
      the motor ocsillating, or becoming unstable and stuck on maximum speed.</p>
      <p>The microcontroller was a Texas Instruments STM32 chip running on the 
      <a href="https://www.mbed.com/en/">ARM Mbed</a> platform. Running the 
      motor controller and the bictoin hash generator required the use of a 
      real-time operating system, to manage the two taks concurrently in 
      seperate threads. Special code was required to enable threads to communicate
      without blocking the whole program. This can be very important in 
      mission-critical applications. All the code was run in C++, which is very
      common in embedded systems due to its good performance.</p>
