      <p>As you probably have gathered from the rest of this website, I really,
      really like music. Having access to my Dad's old piano completely 
      changed my life. However, most other people are not so priveledged. Even
      today, music can be an often unacceptably expensive field to get into. Indeed,
      owning a piano is still probably one of the most sterotypical signs of
      being middle class. As a challenge, and to aquaint myself with the still
      (at the time) mysterious art of electronics, I decided to build a capable
      electronic keyboard, but making it as cheap as possible.</p>
      <p>To do this, I 
      used a broken Casio SA-46 keyboard I bought off eBay. I completely 
      stripped out the innards and gave it MIDI functionality using a Â£1.50
      Arduino baord. I designed a perfboard layout to make the circuit physically
      compact and robust, so I can add more components when I wish to. I also 
      wrote a scanning keyboard matrix tester to quickly and easily work out 
      which keys map to which microcontroller pin, so conversions like this can
      be carried out far more quickly. All project files, including code and 
      circuit diagrams can be found on my GitHub.</p>
      <h3>Current Status</h3>
      <p>The MIDI decoding and matrix testing code is now written, and the keyboard
      is now a fully functional MIDI controller. In the future, I will add its
      own sound synthesizer, as well as re-adding the original speakers, and 
      appropriate amplification/filter circuits to accompany them. Other things 
      I could add include a screen and various buttons for controlling it. I'll
      probably write a smartphone app to accompany it at some point as well, as
      putting a powerful processor and a large screen in a keyboard seems like a 
      waste of time when everyone already has these things with them in their 
      pockets already.</p>
