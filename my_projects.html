      <h2>KnockLock</h2>
      <p>My 2nd year group project was KnockLock, a knock-pattern door unlocker
      for poeple with hand and arm dexterity problems. When people have these 
      conditions (such as Parkinsons), unlocking a door with a key or using a 
      numeric keypad can become extremely difficult and time-consuming. KockLock
      solves this by using several PiezoElectric sensors (similar a 
      <a href="https://github.com/jamesarnold96/Foam_Drumkit">>MIDI drum kit</a>
      I once built) mounted on a door. These sensors create an electric 
      representation of the vibration of the door. By comparing the intensity of 
      the vibration between the sensors, the approximate location on the door of 
      a knock can be detected. By knocking on the door in a specic pattern, an 
      electric motor is triggered, 
      which unlocks the door. The piezo sensor processing is done by an arduino 
      microcontoller. The piezo circuits improve on the MIDI drumkit by including
      RC filters, which prolong the "peaks" of the signal produced by striking the
      surface. This allows the intensity measurement to be far more accurate, 
      as the sampling frequency of the Arduino is sometimes too low to detected
      particularly short peaks.</p>

      <h2>EEBug</h2>
      <p>My first year university group projct was to design and construct a small 
      line-following robot within a specified time frame and budget. I was the 
      team leader for this project, which provided me with valuable leadership 
      experience and project planning skills.
