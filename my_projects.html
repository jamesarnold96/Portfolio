      <h3>Using Computer vision to automatically measure of the propagation of a crack
      through a composite material.</h3>
      <p>My most recently completed project was my 3rd year university group project.
      This was in association with FAC technology, a composite materials company in 
      Southfields (check), London. The composite materials industry is enjoying 
      phenominal gvrowth at the moment, as these materials are increasing adapted in
      industries such as aerospace as a cheaper alternative to metals such as steel
      and aluminium. However, the process of designing these materials can be very 
      long and expensive, due the large number of tests required for regulatory 
      approval. One of the most important tests is the <em>double cantilever beam test
      (create Wikipedia link)</em>, which uses a machine to apply a force to pull 
      apart a small strip of material. The length of the resulting crack is then
      mesured and recorded, and the graph of force versus displacement can be used 
      to determine various structural properties of the material. This process is 
      currently undertaken by a human observer manually using a microscope, making it 
      a significantly labour-intensive and expensive. 
      </br>
      I was part of a team of four who worked to create an automated system for 
      measuring this crack propagation using computer vision. This was done in Python
      using the popular OpenCV computer vision library (provide a link). As can be 
      seen in the video above, 
      TODO: Provide more details.

      <h2>NeZOOMi</h2>
      <h3>Internet-of-things light-following robot for cleaning tubes<h3>
      <p>My second third-year project was the NeZOOMi Internet-of-things 
      light-following robot. 
      This was an adaptaion of the EEBug (TODO: provide link), to automatically
      follow a light-source using a digital light sensor. This vehicle is 
      intended for use in cleaning tubes and tunnels automatically, where it can
      be difficult for humans to access. It was controlled by the hugely popular
      Espressif ESP8266 WiFi microtroller, and recieved instructions from a 
      website, which also advertised and described the project. 
      <a href="NeZOOMi/home.html">This website can be viewed here.</a> My role 
      in this project was to create the website and the Python server which 
      processed instructions from the robot, recieved user instructions,
      served the website, and displayed data.

      <h3>As you probably have gathered from the rest of this website, I really,
      really like music. Having access to my Dad's old Bently piano completely 
      changed my life. However, most other people are not so priveledged. Even
      today, music can be an unacceptably expensive field to get into. Indeed,
      owning a piano is still probably one of the most sterotypical signs that
      someone is middle class. As a challenge, I decided to build a capable
      electronic keyboard, but making it as cheap as possible. To do this, I 
      used a broken Casio SA-46 keyboard I bought off eBay. I completely 
      stripped out the innards and gave it MIDI functionality using a Â£1.50
      Arduino baord.

      <h2>Habitica/Trello task syncing</h2>
      <h3></h3>
      <p>
      I consider myself overburdened with too much curiosity, and often find 
      effective time management difficult. I also struggle with planning and
      prioritizing which tasks need doing. Luckily, I have found salvation in
      the utterly brilliant <a href="https://habitica.com/">Habitica</a>, which 
      turns task management into an RPG game, making the whole process much more
      fun and useful, and makes me far more productive (as a side note, it is
      similar to a somewhat cruder text game I created in high school).</p>
