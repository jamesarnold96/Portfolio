<h2>Crack Tracking System</h2>
<h3>Using Computer vision to automatically measure of the propagation of a crack
through a composite material.</h3>
<p>My most recently completed project was my 3rd year university group project.
This was in association with FAC technology, a composite materials company in 
Southfields (check), London. The composite materials industry is enjoying 
phenominal gvrowth at the moment, as these materials are increasing adapted in
industries such as aerospace as a cheaper alternative to metals such as steel
and aluminium. However, the process of designing these materials can be very 
long and expensive, due the large number of tests required for regulatory 
approval. One of the most important tests is the <em>double cantilever beam test
(create Wikipedia link)</em>, which uses a machine to apply a force to pull 
apart a small strip of material. The length of the resulting crack is then
mesured and recorded, and the graph of force versus displacement can be used 
to determine various structural properties of the material. This process is 
currently undertaken by a human observer manually using a microscope, making it 
a significantly labour-intensive and expensive.

I was part of a team of four who worked to create an automated system for 
measuring this crack propagation using computer vision. This was done in Python
using the popular OpenCV computer vision library (provide a link).
