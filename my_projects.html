      <h2>Brushless motor controler/Bitcoin hash generator</h2>
      <p>My second 3rd-year project was an embedded systems project to write the
      software for a brushless motor controller. The code needed to be able to 
      make the motor rotate a set number of rotations, which had to be significantly
      accurate. This was set by the user, who could also control the maximum 
      rotational velocity of the motor. Whilst this was going on, the 
      microcontroller also computed bitcoin hashes in the background.</p>
      
      <h3>How it Works</h3>
      <p>The brushless motor works by a series of electromagnets around the motor
      being magnetized in sequence, attracting the magnetic rotor to be attracted
      to them. The position of the rotor was measured using a series of infrared
      LEDs and sensors. The rotor had a large slot in it, so when the slot 
      passed over an LED, the sensor would no longer detect a signal. 
      Using this information to control the motor (a closed-loop feedback system)
      required a strong grasp of control theory, particularly PID control systems, to stop
      the motor ocsillating, or becoming unstable and stuck on maximum speed.</p>
      <p>The microcontroller was a Texas Instruments STM32 chip running on the 
      <a href="https://www.mbed.com/en/">ARM Mbed</a> platform. Running the 
      motor controller and the bictoin hash generator required the use of a 
      real-time operating system, to manage the two taks concurrently in 
      seperate threads. Special code was required to enable threads to communicate
      without blocking the whole program. This can be very important in 
      mission-critical applications. All the code was run in C++, which is very
      common in embedded systems due to its good performance.</p>
      
      
      <h2>KnockLock</h2>
      <p>My 2nd year group project was KnockLock, a knock-pattern door unlocker
      for poeple with hand and arm dexterity problems. When people have these 
      conditions (such as Parkinsons), unlocking a door with a key or using a 
      numeric keypad can become extremely difficult and time-consuming. KockLock
      solves this by using several PiezoElectric sensors (similar a 
      <a href="https://github.com/jamesarnold96/Foam_Drumkit">>MIDI drum kit</a>
      I once built) mounted on a door. These sensors create an electric 
      representation of the vibration of the door. By comparing the intensity of 
      the vibration between the sensors, the approximate location on the door of 
      a knock can be detected. By knocking on the door in a specic pattern, an 
      electric motor is triggered, 
      which unlocks the door. The piezo sensor processing is done by an arduino 
      microcontoller. The piezo circuits improve on the MIDI drumkit by including
      RC filters, which prolong the "peaks" of the signal produced by striking the
      surface. This allows the intensity measurement to be far more accurate, 
      as the sampling frequency of the Arduino is sometimes too low to detected
      particularly short peaks.</p>

      <h2>EEBug</h2>
      <p>My first year university group projct was to design and construct a small 
      line-following robot within a specified time frame and budget. I was the 
      team leader for this project, which provided me with valuable leadership 
      experience and project planning skills. 
      
      
      <h2>MIDI keyboard and scanning matrix tester</h2>
      <p>As you probably have gathered from the rest of this website, I really,
      really like music. Having access to my Dad's old piano completely 
      changed my life. However, most other people are not so priveledged. Even
      today, music can be an often unacceptably expensive field to get into. Indeed,
      owning a piano is still probably one of the most sterotypical signs of
      being middle class. As a challenge, and to aquaint myself with the still
      (at the time) mysterious art of electronics, I decided to build a capable
      electronic keyboard, but making it as cheap as possible.</p>
      <p>To do this, I 
      used a broken Casio SA-46 keyboard I bought off eBay. I completely 
      stripped out the innards and gave it MIDI functionality using a Â£1.50
      Arduino baord. I designed a perfboard layout to make the circuit physically
      compact and robust, so I can add more components when I wish to. I also 
      wrote a scanning keyboard matrix tester to quickly and easily work out 
      which keys map to which microcontroller pin, so conversions like this can
      be carried out far more quickly. All project files, including code and 
      circuit diagrams can be found on my GitHub.</p>
      <h3>Current Status</h3>
      <p>The MIDI decoding and matrix testing code is now written, and the keyboard
      is now a fully functional MIDI controller. In the future, I will add its
      own sound synthesizer, as well as re-adding the original speakers, and 
      appropriate amplification/filter circuits to accompany them. Other things 
      I could add include a screen and various buttons for controlling it. I'll
      probably write a smartphone app to accompany it at some point as well, as
      putting a powerful processor and a large screen in a keyboard seems like a 
      waste of time when everyone already has these things with them in their 
      pockets already.</p>
