      <h2 class="content-subhead">About Me</h2>
      <p>I am an electrical and electronic engineering Masters student from London, 
      U. I have worked on a variety of hardware and software projects, which can be 
      viewed on my GitHub <a href=https://github.com/jamesarnold96>here</a>. 
      <br/>
      I have knowledge and experience in a wide variety of areas of electrical 
      engineering, particularly analogue electronics, control systems, signal 
      processing, machine learning, power systems
      In my spare time, I enjoy computer programming,
      drawing, game development and music (I play piano guitar and violin). My current
      major project is a NES-style top-down 2D JavaScript RPG game.
