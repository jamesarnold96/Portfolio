<h1>James Arnold</h1>
<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>I am an electrical and electronic engineering Masters student from London, 
U. I have worked on a variety of hardware and software projects, which can be 
viewed on my GitHub <a href=https://github.com/jamesarnold96>here</a>. 
<br>
I have knowledge and experience in a wide variety of areas of electrical 
engineering, particularly analogue electronics, control systems, signal 
processing, machine learning, power systems
In my spare time, I enjoy computer programming,
drawing, game development and music (I play piano guitar and violin). My current
major project is a NES-style top-down 2D JavaScript RPG game. 
<br>
<h3>Areas I've been involved in</h3>
<p>Maybe have a seperate page for "about me"</p>
<ul>
  <li>Analogue Electronics</li>
  <li>Digital design, FPGAs and Verilog</li>
  <li>Communications systems</li>
  <li>Deterministic and stochastic signal processing</li>
  <li>Classical and state-space control systems</li>
  <li>Electromagnetic field theory</li>
  <li>Machine learning</li>
  <li>Embedded computing</li>
  <li>Power systems</li>
</ul>
<h3>My Computing Skills</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Comprehensive knowldege of the Python and JavaScript programming 
  languages.</li>
  <li>Wide ranging and significant knowledge of scientific computing using 
  MATLAB and Python, as well as computer vision/image processing with OpenCV
  </li>
  <li>Web design experience (such as this one)</li>
  <li>Comprehensive ability to use Microsoft Office software</li>
  <li>Extensive experience of writing in LaTeX.</li>
  <li>Significant knowledge of embedded programming and hardware design using

  and game development in Unity.</li>
  <li>Knowledge 
</ul>
<h3>Other skills</h3>
<ul>
  <li>I'm a profficient pianist, and have been playing it for a long time. I 
  offer extremely competetive rates and am open to enquireries, for both
  performances and teaching.</li>
  <li>I offer tutoring services at very low rates for maths, electronics, 
  physics, music and piano. Please contact me if you are interested.</li>
  <li>I am open to offers of freelance one-off programming or electronic design
  projects. Once again, I offer very competetive rates.</li>
  <li>I do some music composition on the side, and some of my projects will 
  find their way onto this website. I'm open to requests for freelance writing.
  I offer this service for free, and will do it if I feel it is within my 
  abilities and it interests me sufficiently. However, this does not come with
  any explicit quality guarantees.</li>
</ul>

This site is a showcase of the various projects I have been involved in and am 
working on at the moment, as well as a place to demonstrate my skills and 
abilities.
