      <h2 class="content-subhead">General Experience</h2>
      <ul>
		<li>Group leader for my 1st year project at University, which was 
		successfully seen through to completion, designing and building a 
		line-following robot. This helped me to develop leadership, teamwork 
		and project management skills.</li>
		<li>Served as year representative for the student council at secondary 
		school for two years. This helped be to be able to write interestingly and 
		informatively.</li>
		<li>I have been part of the "Imperial College Game Development Society" 
		for the past 2 years, as part of a small team developing a 2D platform game, 
		which has enhanced my teamwork and animation abilities.</li>
		<li>I have pursued an interest in music since a young age, to a high 
		standard, and this has helped me become a hard worker, and develop skills of 
		time management, being able to cope with stress and work to deadlines, and be 
		able to plan and undertake long-running projects.  I have served on the 
		committee of the "Imperial College String Ensemble" for two years as secretary, 
		librarian and treasurer, helping to organize rehearsals and concerts, and undertaking the 
		administrative tasks required for the society to run smoothly</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h2 class="content-subhead">Volunteering</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>I participated for two years in the Imperial College "Pimlico Connection" 
			tutoring where I gave extra maths and science support to local students from 
			disadvantaged backgrounds. I have served as the lead tutor on this scheme, in 
			charge of organizing a group of tutors at one of the schools. This has provided me 
			with valuable and useful leadership experience.</li>
			<li>I have served as a member of the commercial team of Imperial College's "Enactus" society, 
			raising funds for a variety of social enterprises on campus, where I have served as secretary, 
			marketing lead and have taken part in several fundraising activities, which has helped to 
			improve my organizational skills, my ability to work as part of a team, as well as project 
			and event planning skills.</li>
			<li>I also volunteered for a weekend homework club with the "Student Action for Refugees" 
			charity to help refugee children, often with not a great grasp of English, with their schoolwork.</li> 
			<li>I worked with the Imperial College "Equinox" society to help develop a datalogger for 
			monitoring solar panels in Africa.</li>
