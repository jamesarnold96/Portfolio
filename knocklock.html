      <p>My 2nd year group project was KnockLock, a knock-pattern door unlocker
      for poeple with hand and arm dexterity problems. When people have these 
      conditions (such as Parkinsons), unlocking a door with a key or using a 
      numeric keypad can become extremely difficult and time-consuming. KockLock
      solves this by using several PiezoElectric sensors (similar to a 
      <a href="https://github.com/jamesarnold96/Foam_Drumkit">MIDI drum kit</a>
      I once built) mounted on a door. These sensors create an electric 
      representation of the vibration of the door. By comparing the intensity of 
      the vibration between the sensors, the approximate location on the door of 
      a knock can be detected.</p> 
	  <p>By knocking on the door in a specic pattern, an 
      electric motor is triggered, which unlocks the door. The piezo sensor processing
      is done by an arduino microcontoller. The piezo circuits improve on the MIDI
      drumkit by including RC filters, which prolong the "peaks" of the signal
      produced by striking the surface. This allows the intensity measurement to be far
      more accurate, as the sampling frequency of the Arduino is sometimes too
      low to detect particularly short peaks.</p>
      
      <p>A website explaining this project in full detail was made for this project, 
	  and can be found <a href="http://www.ee.ic.ac.uk/zhongxuan.li15/yr2proj/default.html">
