      <h2>NeZOOMi</h2>
      <h3>Internet-of-things light-following robot for cleaning tubes<h3>
      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>My second third-year project was the NeZOOMi Internet-of-things 
      light-following robot. 
      This was an adaptaion of the EEBug (TODO: provide link), to automatically
      follow a light-source using a digital light sensor. This is a prototype of
      a vehicle intended for use in cleaning tubes and tunnels automatically,
      where it can
      be difficult for humans to access. It was controlled by the hugely popular
      Espressif ESP8266 WiFi microtroller, and recieved instructions from a 
      website, which also advertised and described the project. 
      <a href="NeZOOMi/home.html">This website can be viewed here.</a> My role 
      in this project was to create the website and the Python server which 
      processed instructions from the robot, recieved user instructions,
      served the website, and displayed data.</p>
      
      <h3>How it Works</h3>
      <p>The ESP8266 is programmed using the popular <a 
      href="https://micropython.org/">MicroPython</a> microcontroller 
      development platform, which, as the name suggests, allows you to run 
      Python on a microcontroller, rather rather than having to use C/C++ as is       
      customary. Python is far simpler and quicker to program in than C/C++,
      and also reduces the chance of major 
      bugs in the code. The microcontroller collects light level data from an 
      i2c digital lux sensor, and communicats with a PC using the MQTT protocol.
      A Python server running on the PC processes data both from the vehicle 
      and the website. The website backend uses the lovely minimalist web 
      framework <a href="http://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/">Bottle</a> framework 
      to route URLs and process HTTP requests.</p> 
      <p>The website allows the previous 20 light level readins to be displayed
      as a table on the site. It also contains an option to override the default,
      light-following vehicle controls and take manaual control, as can be 
      seen in the video below. The vehicle can now be sterred by the PC's 
      arrow keys.</p>
