      <h3>Using Computer vision to automatically measure of the propagation of a crack
      through a composite material.</h3>
      <h3>Background</h3>
      <p>My most recently completed project was my 3rd year university group project.
      This was in association with FAC technology, a composite materials company in 
      Southfields (check), London. The composite materials industry is enjoying 
      phenominal gvrowth at the moment, as these materials are increasing adapted in
      industries such as aerospace as a cheaper alternative to metals such as steel
      and aluminium. However, the process of designing these materials can be very 
      long and expensive, due the large number of tests required for regulatory 
      approval. One of the most important tests is the <em>double cantilever beam (DCB) test
      </em>, which uses a machine to apply a force to pull 
      apart a small strip of material. The length of the resulting crack is then
      mesured and recorded, and the graph of force versus displacement can be used 
      to determine various structural properties of the material. This process is 
      currently undertaken by a human observer manually using a microscope, making it 
      a significantly labour-intensive and expensive. </p>
      
      <p>I was part of a team of four who worked to create an automated system for 
      measuring this crack propagation using computer vision. This was done in Python
      using the popular <a href="https://opencv.org/">OpenCV</a> computer vision
      library (provide a link). As can be 
      seen in the video above, the system we created works well, and when the 
      measured displacement is plotted against the force exerted by the machine,
      a rough linear relationship is shown, which is what is expected by this 
      test. The scatter of the graphed points is within the 5% required by the 
      idustry specification (check), which shows that it attains a good level of
      accuracy. 
      </p>
      <h3>How it works (technical)</h3>
      The photos taken of the test are taken by an off-the-shelf Canan EOS 70D (check)  
      camera mounted on a tripod, with a black background behind the material 
      sample, so only the sample is visible. The scene is well-illuminated so 
      the sample stands out more, and is mostly white. The camera is set up to
      take a photo every five seconds, which is saved to a folder. The code (written in Python) 
      converts each image to binary black and white (either fully black or 
      fully white), and uses a sequence of edge- and line-detection algorithms
      to isolate the outline of the bar and crack. These outlines are now 
      in white against a black background.</p>
      <p>The crack is then found by
      examining the end of the bar where crack started, and moving along the bar 
      until a column of pixels is reached where there is no white between the 
      boundaries of the bar. This method is very noise-resistant, particularly 
      compared to what was tried initially, which involved finding the first place 
      where there was white. Even the smallest specks of white noise would ruin 
      this algorithm.
      One the coordinates of the tip are found, a vertival line is drawn at
      this point on a copy of the original image, thus clearly showing the 
      crack location for a human observer. Another set of python code automatically
      collects the data from the machine, and all the results end up in a CSV
      format, making it easy to plot Excel graphs for. For very long tests, such
      as fatigue testing, since there doesn't have to be a human observer, the
      frequency of measurements can be massively increased, increasing the 
      accuracy of the data.</p>
